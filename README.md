# Sand House - Gower Climbing Hut
This project aims to create a functional site for a fictional guesthouse on the Gower in South Wales and catering specifically to rock climbers. This is inspired by similar types of accommodation in southern Europe but that rarely exist in the UK. I think this gives scope to include a variety of different aspects and should provide an interesting visual aspect.

## UX

This site will primarily be aimed towards rock climbers looking to get away for a trip to enjoy their favourite passtime in the local area. The project aims to bring together an inspirational site that will make them excited to come to the Gower for a climbing trip and all the practical information they will need to book and ensure that their trip goes smoothly.   
The UX has largely been inspired by my own experiences with finding accommodation when orgaising climbing trips in Europe and everything I would expect to see on these sites. Some examples of these sites:
- [The Olive Branch, Spain](https://www.olivebranchelchorro.com/)
- [Nannai Climbing Home, Sardinia](https://www.climbingulassai.com/)
- [The Orange House, Spain](https://theorangehouse.co.uk/)  
  
The needs of the end user can be sumarised by the following User Stories:  

As a customer I want 
- an intuitive site that allows me to find all the information I need
- a site that works well on mobile devices so that I can browse on the go
- pictures of the accommodation so that I know exactly what it is like
- details of all the facilities that will be available for me to use
- clear information about prices so that I know exactly what it will cost
- details on policies and rules so that I know what is expected of me before and during my stay
- a contact form so that any questions I have can be answered
- a contact number so that I can always get in touch quickly and easily
- a map so that I can find the accommodation easily  

As part of the design process I drew up some wireframes to mock up the intended layout of the site, with different wireframes showing how the site would look over a variety of different device sizes. These wireframes can be seen [here](Wireframes/desktop-wireframes.pdf) for desktop layout, [here](Wireframes/tablet-wireframe.pdf) for tablet layout and [here](Wireframes/mobile-wireframes.pdf) for mobile device layout. Please note that for the tablet view there is only a wireframe for the home page as for the other pages the layout will be the same as wither the mobile or the desktop version.  
  
### Design Considerations

My colour palette found by using colormind.io - an online resourec that uses machine learning to identify colours that work well together. I uploaded a picture (I used my homepage hero image home-splash.jpg) to get suggested complementary colours and these colours are what I then used throughout my site (with the exception of my main logo for which I used a deeper sand colour). These colours match the local landscape and will be reminisent of what the customer will experience when they visit the local area.  
  
I used a variety of typefaces imported from GoogleFonts. I used cursive fonts Lobster and Lemonada for the logo, blurb and sub-headings to give a more casual feel reminisent of the atmosphere of the guesthouse. I used a popular sans-serif typeface Lato for the bulk of the text for easy legibility to convey the information effectively.

## Features

My project includes:
- A floating header/navigation bar that remains visible as the user scrolls down the page, allowing them to easily navigate through different parts of my site easily at all times.
- An embeded Google Map in the footer, making it easy for the customer to know exactly where we are located.
- Image carousels showcasing the different types of accommodation, allowing the user to see a large amount of photos of the room they are interested in without crowding out the page and making it unwieldy.
- A contact form allowing the customer to easily get in touch with the business.  

### Features Left to Implement

Some features that could possibly be implemented in the future but that couldn't be included at this time:
- An availabillity calendar allowing customers to see exactly when any given accommodation is available to book.
- An integrated payments system allowing customers to book and pay for their stay in one visit to the page.
